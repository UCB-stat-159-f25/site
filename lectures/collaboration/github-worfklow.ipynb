    "A very common quote in the open source community is\n",
    "> \"Release early, release often\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this? Because this will provide me with feedback from the community that will furthermore help moving the software forward. This is very different than the secretive way many times traditional science tend to work. Not doing this encourages bad practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular quote from know as Linus's Law is \n",
    "> \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to the other quote: with more people looking at more code, the changes of making big mistakes are smaller and the software becomes more robust. This doesn't mean that our code will \n",
    "\n",
    "These two capture a key principle: share your work openly from as early as possible, and thus get more people to look at your work, and the result will be better.  Trick is - how do we put this in practice? The trick is to use \n",

    "- In the cloud, GitHub (and other similar services like GitLab) becomes your point for collaboration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like the original word atomic that means _indivisible_, this means that we should make commits that express one single idea or implementation. This doesn't necessarily means that we need to commit small changes, but instead each commit implements a new change. Also, we want this commit to have a short message (the standard is less that XX lines). After the first line of the commit message, we can add a longer description. "

Having multiple branches allow us to explore the evolution of the progress much better and in a non-linear fashion. Remember that branches can always being merged, so eventually we can combine different stories of project into the same commit. "

Furthermore, I don't just update one single commit at the time. Instead, we create what is know as a pull request. A pull request means that one user is _requesting_ to some other users to _review_ some changes and eventually approve those changes. An advantage of doing this is that GitHub allow us to maintain an communication between the parts in which feedback and comment can be done. Further changes can be implemented until the pull requests go approved. Also, think in cases where the new changes need to be tested before being incorporated. The moment for running and checking the tests is the PR, where we can also make the changes until all potential checks pass. \n",

    "As we mentioned before, a pull request opens a conversation between the part that is bringing the new implementation and the current maintainers of the software.
