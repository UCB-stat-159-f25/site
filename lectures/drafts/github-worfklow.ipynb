    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". \n",
    "\n",
    "These two capture a key principle: share your work openly from as early as possible, and thus get more people to look at your work, and the result will be better.  Trick is - how do we put this in practice?\n",

    "- Git, with remotes, connects your local workflow to the cloud. \n",
    "- In the cloud, GitHub (and other similar services like GitLab) becomes your point for collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all this, _communication is key_. Git is only a technical tool that helps you manage a kind of data (the contents of your repository). It is not a replacement for working with humans - **that's your job!**\n",

    "## Key habits to pick up\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good atomic commits, with proper comments.\n",
    "- Group them in branches that address one problem at a time.\n",
    "- When ready for feedback, make a Pull Request for this work.\n",
    "- Your PR description should summarize the overall purpose of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work well, you need an `upstream` repository for the common work, and your personal `origin` one. For example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) (staging)longs[stat159]> git remote -v\n",
    "origin\tgit@github.com:fperez/datahub.git (fetch)\n",

    "This separates your personal workspace from that of the team, and it's a good habit to get into even if you have direct commit rights to the group workspace."
