# Homework

Homeworks will be announced in Ed Discussion and submitted using GitHub Classroom. The Ed announcement will include a link that you will use to create a 
repository in the [course GitHub site](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s25). In order to submit your homework, you will need to push your last changes to 
this GitHub repository. 

We will accept late homework assignments until 24hrs after the deadline of the homework. However, in those cases a 25% penalty will be applied to the final score. In case of emergency, please reach out to the instructors using Ed Discussion.

A running list of homework assignments, along with due dates, will be provided below and updated periodically throughout the semester.
