    "## 1. Collaborating on GitHub with a small team\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to set up a shared collaboration with one partner (the person sitting next to you).  This will show the basic workflow of collaborating on a project with a small team where everyone have write privileges to the same repository.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will have two people, let's call them Alice and Bob, sharing a repository.  Alice will be the owner of the repository and she will give Bob write privileges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a simple synchronization example, much like we just did above, but now between **two people** instead of one person.  Otherwise it's the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice creates a new repository in GitHub with some basic text files on it (this could be the same one that you use for the previous exercise).\n",
    "- Bob clones Alice's repository.\n",
    "- Bob makes changes to a file and commits them locally.\n",
    "- Bob pushes his changes to GitHub.\n",
    "- Alice pulls Bob's changes into her own repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will have both parties make non-conflicting changes each, and commit them locally.  Then both try to push their changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice adds a new file, `alice.txt` to the repo and commits.\n",
    "- Add a tag to this stage of the repository. What is a [tag](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html) and how to make one?\n",
    "- Bob adds `bob.txt` and commits.\n",
    "- Alice pushes to GitHub.\n",
    "- Bob tries to push to GitHub.  What happens here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that Bob's changes create a commit that conflicts with Alice's, so git refuses to apply them.  It forces Bob to first do the merge on his machine, so that if there is a conflict in the merge, Bob deals with the conflict manually (git could try to do the merge on the server, but in that case if there's a conflict, the server repository would be left in a conflicted state without a human to fix things up).  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes."

    "## 2. Reconstructing past versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we make accidental changes to some of the files in a repository, or maybe we just want to comeback to a previous version. In any case, it is easy to restore or even recover old versions of files that have been track in a commit message. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these next examples, we are going to use the `git checkout` command to restore past versions of a file. This can lead to some confussion, since this is the same command we use for changing branches. In a sense, `git checkout` does both the work of `git switch` and `git restore`. You can do all the following exercises with `git restore` instead of `git checkout`.  "

    "1. Make more than one change in the same file in your repository, for example you can use write some new text inside `text.txt`. With `echo \"...\" >> text.txt` you will print new lines at the end of `text.txt` (with `>` you will just overwrite all the contents). \n",
